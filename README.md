This collection of Jupyter notebooks documents my learning as I progress through the Data Mining and Predictive Analytics book. These notebooks will be fairly comprehensive, but not exhaustive. The code in this repository solves R exercises in the book using Python. The exercises involve data preparation, statistical analysis, classification, clustering, association rules, and model optimization.
